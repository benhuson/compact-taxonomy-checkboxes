Collapse and reduce the height of hierarchical category and taxonomy panels in the WordPress admin.

== Description ==

Collapse and reduce the height of hierarchical category and taxonomy panels in the WordPress admin.

It's always bugged me that when editing a post the categories panel takes up so much height if you only have a few categories. This is also the same for custom hierarchical taxonomies.

This plugin just adds a couple of styles to your admin to override this and collapse that space.

I have created a patch for this which will at some point hopefully make it into WordPress core. You can [follow the progress of the patch here](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15925).
