Collapse and reduce the height of hierarchical category and taxonomy panels in the WordPress admin (not needed for WordPress 3.5+).

== Description ==

> *This plugin in only required for versions prior to WordPress 3.5*

This plugin collapses and reduces the height of hierarchical category and taxonomy panels in the WordPress admin.

It always bugged me that when editing a post the categories panel took up so much height if you only had a few categories. This was also the same for custom hierarchical taxonomies.

This plugin just adds a couple of styles to your admin to override this and collapse that space.

I created an initial patch for this which, with contributions from other WordPress developers, was included in WordPress 3.5. You can [see the patch here...](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15925)
